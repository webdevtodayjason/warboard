"""WARBOARD storage layer. Stdlib only.

One SQLite file, WAL mode: the pipeline holds a writer connection and the server
holds reader connections to the same file at the same time. Writers wrap mutations
in `with con:` so a crash mid-batch never leaves a half-written row.

Prefer one connection per thread (connect() is cheap). Connections are created with
check_same_thread=False so a shared connection also works, but transactions on a
shared connection are global to that connection -- two threads writing through one
connection can commit each other's work.

RETENTION POLICY (rewritten 2026-08-21 -- the archive is the product)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The AI analysis is the valuable output of this box, so it is the one thing that is
never thrown away:

  items + analysis   kept FOREVER by default. WARBOARD_ITEM_RETENTION_DAYS sets a
                     window if an operator wants one; 0/unset = keep everything.
                     Measured cost: ~9.9 KB/article => ~4.3 GB/year, on a host with
                     4.4 TB free. Bounded by arithmetic, not by deletion.
  metrics (raw)      high-frequency telemetry, dropped after WARBOARD_METRIC_
                     RETENTION_DAYS (default 8) -- but rollup_metrics() folds every
                     COMPLETED hour into metrics_hourly first, so the long-run trend
                     survives the raw rows. Hourly rows are ~192/day (~3 MB/year).
  images             bounded by disk cap, not by age: WARBOARD_IMAGE_CAP_GB (default
                     20). Orphans go first, then the lowest-severity oldest images.
                     An S4/S5 item's image is never deleted.
  oplog              48h. It narrates; it is not the record.

Nothing here grows without a bound the operator can state in one sentence.

# --- index choices (items lives forever, so every hot query must be a seek) ----
#
# At 21-day retention the table topped out around 20k rows and a full scan was
# cheap enough to be invisible. Kept forever it passes 500k inside a year, and
# three queries run on a timer against it, so each one gets an index shaped like
# its ORDER BY, not just its WHERE:
#
# idx_items_recent  (COALESCE(published,fetched_at) DESC, id DESC)
#     WHERE enriched_at IS NOT NULL
#   recent_items sorts on the COALESCE expression, so a plain column index cannot
#   serve it -- SQLite would scan every row and sort. The expression index makes
#   the ORDER BY ... LIMIT a scan of the first N index entries. Partial on
#   `enriched_at IS NOT NULL` (that exact term is in the query, which is what lets
#   SQLite use a partial index) keeps unenriched rows out of it entirely.
# idx_items_region_recent / idx_items_category_recent
#   Same shape, keyed by the filter the AOR cards and category chips send. Without
#   them a filtered view of a quiet region walks the whole global ordering to find
#   100 matching rows.
# idx_items_pending  (fetched_at, id) WHERE enriched_at IS NULL
#   The one that matters most long-term: pending_items and counts()['pending'] run
#   every couple of seconds, and in a forever-archive ~100% of rows are enriched,
#   so an unpartitioned index would make every poll walk the entire history to find
#   nothing. This index only ever contains the live queue -- a handful of rows.
# idx_items_enriched_at  (enriched_at DESC) WHERE enriched_at IS NOT NULL
#   clustered_embeddings (enriched_at >= since) and counts()['enriched_24h'].
#   The partial clause is load-bearing in a second way: a full index on
#   enriched_at makes `enriched_at IS NULL` look like an equality seek, and the
#   planner picks it for pending_items and then sorts in a temp b-tree. Excluding
#   NULLs leaves idx_items_pending as the only candidate for the queue query.
# idx_items_cluster  (cluster_id, severity)
#   Widened from (cluster_id): _refresh_cluster's COUNT(*) and MAX(severity) per
#   cluster are now answered from the index without touching the table.
# idx_items_embedded  (id) WHERE embedding IS NOT NULL
#   archive_stats counts embedded rows; without it that count scans 500k rows that
#   each carry a 4 KB blob.
# idx_clusters_updated  (updated_at DESC)
#   top_clusters orders by updated_at; clusters accumulate alongside items now.
#
# Cost of all this: ~6 extra index writes per inserted item (one row per 300s
# fetch cycle) and a one-time build when an existing DB is first opened.
# EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN assertions in the self-check below pin the behaviour.
