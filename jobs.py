"""WARBOARD idle-time deep work — the scheduler that keeps the NPU earning.

The enrichment queue is the device's day job: every incoming wire item gets a
summary, a category, a region and a severity. But the queue drains. On a quiet
feed cycle the Tiiny sat idle apart from one ad-hoc image render bolted onto the
sitrep loop. This module is what it does instead, and it is where every new
long-form job type lives:

  recluster   DB-only sweep: enriched items that never landed in a cluster get
              one, and clusters that grew past the label threshold get an
              AI-written headline. Cheap; runs most often.
  synthesis   One COCOM region at a time, round-robin: 24h of that AOR's wire
              read into a regional assessment.
  dossier     The hottest entity (country/actor) on the wire that has not been
              written up recently: 14 days of its coverage read into a dossier.
  image       Backfill one missing S4+ story render (the old _autoimage_one),
              honouring BOTH caps: WARBOARD_IMAGE_DAILY_CAP renders/day and the
              WARBOARD_IMAGE_CAP_GB disk ceiling db.prune_images enforces.
  brief       Once per UTC day: the executive brief for the day just ended,
              built from that day's syntheses, dossiers and top wire items. Also
              dropped into digests/ so the R2 loop ships it offsite.

Three invariants, enforced here so pipeline.py cannot get them wrong:

  1. NOTHING runs while db.counts()['pending'] > 0. Enrichment always wins.
  2. Every device call takes the lease -- BOTH keys, chat work included.
     `img_hold_until` is the one every consumer actually polls (the enricher's
     between-item yield, the cluster labeller, wait_for_quiet below);
     `enrich_busy_until` is what server.py's on-demand image endpoint waits out.
     Advertising only enrich_busy_until for a 250s dossier left the enricher free
     to start a second chat call on the same device, so a job now takes both.
     Release is compare-and-clear (_release): a blind "0" would zero somebody
     else's live lease.
  3. SIGTERM exits cleanly: jobs check ctx.stopped() between units of work and a
     job never holds a lease across a stop.

Output lands in the `docs` table (kind = dossier|synthesis|brief) and every job
narrates itself into the oplog, so the AI OPS LOG on the board shows the device
working even when the wire is quiet.

CLI (this is also the operator's "brief script"):
    python3 jobs.py                     one scheduler pass, gates respected
    python3 jobs.py --status            what is due, what ran last, what exists
    python3 jobs.py --brief             file today's brief for the previous UTC day
    python3 jobs.py --brief --day 2026-08-20 --force     re-run a specific day
    python3 jobs.py --job synthesis --force              force one job now
    python3 jobs.py --selfcheck         no-device wiring check on a temp DB
